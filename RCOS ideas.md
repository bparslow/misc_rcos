### Some ideas I have for RCOS after mentoring for two semesters 
* I think that the resources and assignment outlines for RCOS can be scattered all over the place. I personally have a hard time keeping track and I know students do too (especially based on their asking mentors for links over and over again). I would love if everything were consolidated into one space whether its a GitHub repository on the RCOS account or a shared Google Drive folder where all the Google Docs can be dropped throughout the semester.
	* GitHub would be great because it’s making even more of RCOS open-source (!) and the RCOS GitHub page is easy to find. The pinned repository could just be markdown files of all the assignment outlines. They could be updated each semester right in the repository, which would be great for returning RCOS members to see what changed about an assignment’s guidelines. This public-facing option would be awesome for prospective RCOS members that go to RPI but may want to know what the class entails before registering.
	* A Google Drive folder would be the simplest switch from the current system, but would mean that only one link needs to be distributed all semester. 
* I’ve talked to Professor Turner about this before, but I there should be a way for all of the mentors to see the “Anything blocking?” section of students’ status updates. If this isn’t possible, then I would love to see a way for students to have a more open dialogue about the things that are preventing them from moving forward. I think this could even take the form of a Mattermost channel, but I don’t know if people would use it, or a more prominent part of stand up. I just worry that students are stuck and that the answers are nearby (especially in a community like ours) but inaccessible, and that this could prevent someone from doing the best work that they can. 
* A Git workshop should be required for all new RCOS members. The amount of people that still don’t know Git and basic open-source concepts midway through the semester can be frustrating and worrying. They should have to complete the workshop and a tutorial within the first two weeks of class. I think this would be instrumental in making sure that new people don’t fall behind (this definitely happened to me during my first semester). 
* I wish there were more incentive to attend RCOS workshops, because they can be super interesting but under-attended. Sometimes I miss large group from the time of long student presentations and I think there could be more of a happy medium.
* Thanks for listening to my thoughts! I think they’re all relatively minor changes that could help RCOS and I’d be happy to help implement any of them.
