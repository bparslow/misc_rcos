# On Design
I give this talk as my workshop every semester, so I adapted it to a little guide. I hope this could be sent to any beginner people in RCOS who are looking to improve their project’s presentation.

## Design has impact.
Design can determine whether or not something is perceived as legitimate, trustworthy, or professional. It can also make or break a person’s experience, or determine whether or not they spend money on some product.

## What is good design?
Design should—at the very least—not hinder your ability to communicate information or a message. Ideally, design will strengthen that information.

Don’t feel like you need to overdo it. In RCOS, we have small projects and virtually no budgets. Simple, effective design is great for our scale. 

## Some mistakes you might be making
### You might be overusing centered text. 
* Reserve centering for small amounts of information. It’s appropriate for a header, the name on a business card, or a short objective statement on something like a resume.
* Centering large paragraphs and lists hinders readability, as the centering makes the starting point of each line inconsistent with the next. This makes it more difficult for the eye to predict where the next line will begin and therefore requires more work than is necessary from the reader. 

### You might not have enough contrast between your background and text.
* This lack of contrast can lead to strain on the eye. It then requires too much effort to get your meaning across and can frustrate the user. 
* If you’re unsure if there’s enough contrast, use [a color contrast checker like this one by Mari Johannessen](https://marijohannessen.github.io/color-contrast-checker/).  These suggestions abide by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#contents). 

### You might be abusing tools used for emphasis.
* Emphasis is “a special importance, value, or prominence given to something.”
* What makes it special? The lack of it. When you overuse tools like bolding, underlining, italics, quotations, different fonts, and capitalization, you rob them of their ability to stand out. Use these tools intentionally and never all at once. 
* Do not place large blocks of text in all capital letters. It makes the text harder to read, which then leaves your important message less likely to be read. 
* Underlining should be reserved for links.

### You might have line lengths that are too long.
* Be conscious of how far your text stretches across the page. If it’s too long, the reader will lose their place and be forced to refocus, which can be a frustrating experience. If it’s too narrow for a large body of text, it could disrupt the reader’s rhythm.
* A good range is ~40 to 90 characters, and 90 is honestly pushing it. Add margins, padding, or columns to give your text room to breathe. 

### You might be neglecting ~5% of the population.
* Visual impairments that hinder the ability to distinguish some forms, such as color vision deficiency, affect a lot of people. 
* Do not rely solely on color to indicate meaning. Use it more to enhance or make something more appealing. 
* You never really know who you are excluding when you neglect visual impairments in your designs.
* Use a tool like this [color blind filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter) to see how your designs look to people with visual impairments. 

### You might be mistreating your typefaces.
* Don’t use too many different typefaces. Use variations on the ones you’re already using. If it’s a “good” all-purpose font it’ll have a lot of variations in weight and you can use these to differentiate certain areas of your design. 
* Don’t overuse heavily decorated specialized fonts. They’re appropriate for headers, titles, and logos, but not large amounts of body text because they’re unreadable. 
* Avoid the default cursive fonts. They’ve improved a lot over the past few years, but the good ones cost money because they required more work to make. Almost every letter connector is unique and needs to be created by a designer to look right, hence the higher price. If you do decide to use them, treat them similarly to heavily decorated fonts. 
* Don’t use monospace fonts for anything besides code. These fonts are not optimized for readability for large amounts of text, but they’re associated with code so they’re appropriate to use for that. 

## Some resources to help you along your way
###  [practicaltypography.com](https://practicaltypography.com/) 
* Very sassy and straightforward typography blog. Gives font recommendations, talks about every aspect of text formatting, gives sample documents. This person is very opinionated, so keep that in mind. As you continue to design things, you will find the style that you like and it doesn’t matter if this person will like it or not. 
	
###  [thinkingwithtype.com](http://thinkingwithtype.com/) 
* This is a digital version of a textbook we used in my design classes here. Covers basic topics like: anatomy of type, type families, hierarchy, spacing, alignment, and grid design. You should look into these topics more if you find that you like design and want to pursue it further. 

### Font websites 
* [fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/) 
	* Open source and free
* [fonts.adobe.com/collections/](https://fonts.adobe.com/collections) 
	* Free with most Adobe subscriptions and has a lot more available
* [canva.com/font-combinations/](https://www.canva.com/font-combinations/) 
	* If you’re having trouble pairing fonts, looking at this link or the link below may give you some inspiration. 
* [reliablepsd.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/](https://www.reliablepsd.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/) 
	* This font pairing site focuses only on Google fonts, with is awesome if you want to still solely to open-source for your design resources,

### Some random things
* [Refactoring UI Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/i/moments/994601867987619840)
	* Great grouping of tweets that shows small changes to interface designs that make a big difference and the reasoning behind them.
* [10 Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
	* These are Jakob Nielsen’s 10 general principles for UI design that focus a lot on the user’s satisfaction. This is covered in Professor Kimball’s human-computer interaction classes and is fundamental to good user experiences. 
	* If you are designing an entire program from scratch, I highly highly recommend reading these and watching all the videos.

## Final thoughts
Talk about and share the things you make. Watch people use your products and designs. Solicit feedback from them and act on those responses. It will always make your projects better.
